# MedoidBasedWeightedTkNN
An attempt to overcome the limitations of Nearest Neighbour Classifiers.
# Description of the codebase
The file named "cosine_weighted_tkNN" (both .py and .ipynb) consists of implementation of the algorithm.
The file named "Classifiers" (both .py and .ipynb) consists of black boxes of different classifiers which could run with a given data and produce precision, recall and F1-Score on test as well as train data.
