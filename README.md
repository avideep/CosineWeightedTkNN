Implementation of the algorithm in the paper entitled "[A medoid‑based weighting scheme for nearest‑neighbor decision rule
toward efective text categorization](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-020-2738-8.pdf)"

The code `MkNN.py` contains the algorithm implemented in a regular scikit-learn classifier fashion.

An example of how to run the code is shown in `testing.py`.
